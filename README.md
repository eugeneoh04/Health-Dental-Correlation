General health screening results and dental screening results from the South Korean health checkup dataset was analyzed to observe a correlation.
Data was cleaned in the Data Cleaning.ipynb file and analyzed using GBM, LR, and RFC.
All three models failed to show predictive capabilities leading to supporting the null hypothesis of no relationship between general medical screening results and dental screening existing.
